# medicine
A app to identify the closest UBS (Unidade Basica de Saude) next to you.
UBS is a place that distribute free medicines for poor people. The problem is because anyone can`t discovery which medicine there is in each one, the ideia is create a comunity app that tells how many and what medicine there is in the especific UBS.
